      "response": "## Explanation: Multi-Agent System\n\nA multi-agent system (MAS) consists of multiple autonomous agents that interact, collaborate, or compete to achieve individual or collective goals. Unlike single-agent systems, where one agent operates in isolation, MAS emphasizes distributed problem-solving through coordination and communication between agents. Each agent in an MAS has its own knowledge, goals, and decision-making capabilities, enabling the system to handle complex tasks by dividing them into",

LangGraph provides tools to define agent roles, communication protocols, and workflows. The system typically includes components like agent nodes (individual AI models or functions), routing logic (to direct tasks between agents), and state management (to track progress). C",
